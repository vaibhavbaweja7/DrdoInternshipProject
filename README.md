# DrdoInternshipProject
This project which includes two jupyter notebooks was my submission for my internship at Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences,Defense Research and Devlopment Organisation India.
My work at internship revolved around electroencephalogram (EEG) signals and Brain Computer Interface(BCI). 
These two files include trial wise decoding and cropped decoding on BCI Competition IV 2a dataset using brain-decode which is a deep learning toolbox to decode raw time domain EEG.
Deep learning models are made with best validation accuracy of 0.2639 in trial wise decoding and 0.4757 in croppeddecoding.
